    "# Module 4: Unsupervised Learning\n\n## Course 3: Advanced Classification Models for Student Success\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udea7 Module Under Development\n\nThis module will cover **unsupervised learning** techniques for higher education analytics. Content is being developed and will be available soon.\n\n### Planned Topics\n\n- Clustering (K-Means, DBSCAN, Hierarchical)\n- Dimensionality Reduction (PCA, t-SNE, UMAP)\n- Student Segmentation and Profiling\n- Anomaly Detection for Early Warning\n\n### How Unsupervised Learning Fits the Course\n\nWhile Modules 1-3 focused on **supervised learning** (predicting a known outcome like departure), unsupervised learning discovers **hidden patterns** in data without labels. This is valuable for:\n\n- Identifying natural student segments for targeted interventions\n- Reducing high-dimensional data for visualization\n- Discovering unexpected patterns in student behavior\n\n---\n\n*Details for this module will be provided by the instructor. Check back for updates.*"
